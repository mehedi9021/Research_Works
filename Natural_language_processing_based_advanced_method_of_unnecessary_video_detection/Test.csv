0,Let's go again.
0,"I don't know anything! God, don't!"
0,"You're not playing the odds, friend."
0,Let's do it again.
0,You'd leave a man's life to chance?
0,Not exactly.
0,"His name's Schiff, Thomas."
0,"He's a paranoid schizophrenic,"
0,former patient at Arkham.
0,The kind of mind the Joker attracts.
0,What do you expect to learn from him?
0,The Joker killed Gordon.
0,He's gonna kill Rachel.
0,You're the symbol of hope
0,I could never be.
0,Your stand against organized crime
0,is the first legitimate ray of light
0,in Gotham in decades.
0,"If anyone saw this,"
0,everything would be undone.
0,The criminals you arrested
0,would be released
0,and Jim Gordon
0,will have died for nothing.
0,You're gonna hold
0,a press conference tomorrow.
0,Why?
0,No one else will die because of me.
0,Gotham's in your hands now.
0,You can't.
0,You can't give in.
0,You can't give in!
0,Harvey called.
0,He said Batman's gonna turn himself in.
0,I have no choice.
0,You honestly think that's gonna
0,keep the Joker from killing people?
0,Maybe not. But I have enough blood
0,on my hands.
0,And I've seen now what I would
0,have to become to stop men like him.
0,You once told me that
0,if the day came when I was finished
0,that we'd be together.
0,"Bruce, don't make me"
0,your one hope for a normal life.
0,Did you mean it?
0,Yes.
0,Bruce.
0,"If you turn yourself in,"
0,they're not gonna let us be together.
0,ALFRED: Logs as well?
0,BRUCE: Everything.
0,Anything that could lead back
0,to Lucius or Rachel.
0,"People are dying, Alfred."
0,What would you have me do?
0,"Endure, Master Wayne. Take it."
0,"They'll hate you for it,"
0,but that's the point of Batman.
0,He can be the outcast. He can make
0,the choice that no one else can make.
0,The right choice.
0,"No, today I found out"
0,what Batman can't do.
0,He can't endure this.
0,"Today you get to say ""I told you so."""
0,"Today, I don't want to."
0,But I did bloody tell you.

0,ALFRED: I suppose they're gonna
0,lock me up as well
0,as your accomplice.
0,BRUCE: Accomplice? I'm gonna tell them
0,the whole thing was your idea.
0,"Ladies and gentlemen, I've called"
0,this press conference for two reasons.
0,"Firstly, to assure the citizens"
0,of Gotham
0,that everything that can be done
0,over the Joker killings is being done.
0,[CHATTERING]
0,"Secondly, because the Batman"
0,has offered to turn himself in.
0,But let's consider the situation.
0,Should we give in
0,to this terrorist's demands?
0,Do we really think he's gonna?
0,You'd rather protect an outlaw vigilante
0,than the lives of citizens?
0,The Batman is an outlaw.
0,That's not why we demand he turn himself
0,"in, we're doing it because we're scared."
0,We've been happy to let Batman
0,clean up our streets till now.
0,MAN : Things are worse than ever!
0,MAN : Amen.
0,"Yes, they are."
0,But the night is darkest
0,just before the dawn.
0,And I promise you
0,the dawn is coming.
0,"One day, the Batman will have to answer"
0,for the laws he's broken. But to us
0,not to this madman.
0,No more dead cops!
0,OFFICERS: Yeah!
0,He should turn himself in!
0,MAN : Give us the Batman! Come on!
0,MAN : Where is he?
0,So be it. Take the Batman into custody.
0,WOMAN: What?
0,MAN : Is he here?
0,I am the Batman.
0,MAN : What?
0,MAN : Come on.
0,RACHEL:
0,Alfred.
0,Why is he letting Harvey do this?
0,He went down to the press conference.
0,I know. He just stood by.
0,Perhaps both Bruce and Mr. Dent
0,believe that Batman stands for
0,something more important
0,"than the whims of a terrorist,"
0,Miss Dawes
0,even if everyone hates him for it.
0,That's the sacrifice he's making.
0,He's not being a hero.
0,He's being something more.
0,"Yeah, you're absolutely right."
0,Letting Harvey take the fall for this
0,is not heroic at all.
0,You know him better than anyone.
0,I do.
0,Will you give this to him for me?
0,When the time is right?
0,How will I know?
0,It's not sealed.

0,And we wish him a speedy recovery.
0,"Because God knows, we need him now."
0,You said you were a man of your word.
0,"Oh, I am."
0,I'm only burning my half.
0,All you care about is money.
0,This town deserves

0,it's about sending a message.

0,"Who is this?

0,The Mob ground out a little profit
0,and the police tried to shut them down
0,one block at a time.
0,And it was so boring.
0,I've had a change of heart.
0,I don't want Mr. Reese

0,you'll know that I'm telling the truth.
0,I'm gonna need your weapon.
0,What?
0,Why? Because my wife's in the hospital?

0,at my family?
0,BARBARA: No!
0,We have a winner.
0,"No, Jim, stop him!"
0,GORDON: Harvey.
0,BARBARA: Don't let him
0,Harvey!
0,[BARBARA SOBBING]
0,I'm sorry!
0,For everything.
0,Please don't hurt my son.
0,[DOGS BARKING]
0,[CHATTERING]
0,You brought your cops?
0,All they know is there's a situation.
0,They don't know who or what.
0,They're just creating a perimeter.
0,You think I wanna escape from this?
0,There is no escape from this.
0,"You don't wanna hurt the boy, Harvey."
0,"It's not about what I want,"
0,it's about what's fair!
0,You thought we could be decent men
0,in an indecent time.
0,But you were wrong.
0,The world is cruel. And the only morality
0,in a cruel world
0,is chance.
0,Unbiased.
0,Unprejudiced.
0,Fair.
0,His son's got the same chance she had.
0,Fifty-fifty.
0,What happened to Rachel wasn't chance.
0,We decided to act.
0,We three.
0,Then why was it me who was
0,the only one who lost everything?
0,It wasn't.
0,The Joker chose me.
0,Because you were the best of us.
0,He wanted to prove that
0,even someone as good as you
0,could fall.
0,And he was right.
0,"You're the one pointing the gun, Harvey."
0,So point it at the people responsible.
0,Fair enough.
0,You first.
0,My turn.
0,"Harvey, you're right."
0,Rachel's death was my fault.
0,Please don't punish the boy.
0,"Please, punish me."
0,I'm about to.
0,Tell your boy
0,"he's gonna be all right, Gordon."
0,Lie
0,like I lied.
0,"It's going to be all right, son."
0,[BATMAN GRUNTS]
0,[BARBARA SCREAMS]
0,"Dad? Daddy, is he okay?"
0,[BATMAN PANTING]
0,Thank you.
0,You don't have to thank me.
0,"Yes, I do."
0,The Joker won.
0,"Harvey's prosecution,"
0,everything he fought for
0,".""undone."
0,Whatever chance you gave us at fixing
0,our city dies with Harvey's reputation.
0,We bet it all on him.
0,The Joker took the best of us
0,and tore him down.
0,People will lose hope.
0,They won't.
0,They must never know what he did.
0,Five dead.
0,Two of them cops. You can't sweep that
0,No.
0,But the Joker cannot win.
0,Gotham needs its true hero.
0,No.
0,You either die a hero
0,or you live long enough
0,to see yourself become the villain.
0,I can do those things
0,"because I'm not a hero, not like Dent."
0,I killed those people.
0,That's what I can be.
0,"No, no, you can't. You're not."
0,I'm whatever Gotham needs me to be.
0,Call it in.
0,GORDON:
0,A hero.
0,"Not the hero we deserved,"
0,but the hero we needed.
0,Nothing less than a knight
0,shining.
0,GORDON.
0,They'll hunt you.
0,BATMAN:
0,You'll hunt me.
0,You'll condemn me.
0,Set the dogs on me.
0,Because that's what needs to happen.
0,Because sometimes
0,the truth isn't good enough.
0,Sometimes people deserve more.
0,Sometimes people deserve
0,to have their faith rewarded.
0,[ELECTRICITY CRACKLING]
0,JAMES:
0,Batman.
0,Batman!
0,"Why's he running, Dad?"
0,Because we have to chase him.
0,"Okay, we're going in! Go, go! Move!"
0,He didn't do anything wrong.
0,"Because he's the hero Gotham deserves,"
0,but not the one it needs right now.
0,So we'll hunt him
0,because he can take it.
0,Because he's not a hero.
0,He's a silent guardian
0,a watchful protector.
0,A dark knight.
